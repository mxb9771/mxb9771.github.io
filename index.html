        The CloudSmartz Application Performance Predictor is a web application
        that will predict the performance viability of a given software
        application across a variety of different environments and contexts.
        Data visualization will be accomplished via a user-friendly dashboard
        interface. The relevant metrics taken into account are throughput,
        jitter, packet loss, and latency. Acceptable values of each metric are
        defined by the related Service Level Agreements (SLAâ€™s). Data will be
        collected in real time over a range of 30 days and will be used to help
        the users interpret and assess the performance of applications in
        different contexts.This will assist in determining which parameters
        could exceed performance constraints. The Application Performance
        Predictor Engine will be developed on a backend of Java APIs using the
        Spring framework and the data will be stored using MySQL. Development of
        the frontend will use JavaScript with the Angular framework. The project
        will utilize a CI/CD pipeline supported through Jenkins. The Agile
        Methodology will be employed to drive the process forward, specifically
        following the Scrum framework.
