        The CloudSmartz Application Performance Predictor is a web application
        that can predict the performance viability of a given software
        application across a variety of different environments and contexts. For
        a given application and deployment location, the user will see an
        indication of whether the performance will be optimal, fair, or poor.
        Data visualization will be accomplished via a user-friendly dashboard
        interface. The relevant metrics taken into account are throughput,
        jitter, packet loss, and latency. Acceptable values of each metric are
        defined by the related Service Level Agreements (SLA) for a given
        application. Data collected over a range of 30 days will be used to
        evaluate the applicationâ€™s performance against the thresholds defined by
        the SLA for each metric, then against user-defined standards for optimal
        performance. The Application Performance Predictor Engine will be
        developed on a backend of Java APIs using the Spring framework, and the
        data will be stored in a MySQL database. Development of the frontend
        will use TypeScript with the Angular framework. The project will utilize
        a CI/CD pipeline supported through Jenkins. The Agile model will be
        employed to drive the process forward, specifically following the Scrum
        framework. There will be a variety of both process and project metrics
        used to track overall progress and quality, such as burndown rate,
        cyclomatic complexity, and average bug-fix time. On a continuous basis,
        the sponsor will be updated with progress reports and demos showcasing
        new features as they are developed. Our process will enable visibility
        that will allow us to verify our product and work with the sponsor to
        validate its fulfillment of the requirements.
